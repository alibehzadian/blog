!["Definition of Done"](/images/definition-of-done.jfif)
When you are developing software, no matter web or mobile application, you need to make sure that everything is done (and offcourse done right). So you need a way to define the "Done!" itself. I had such a problem and searched for this and gather all definitions and combined them together. The result is:

# DoD checklist for a user story

## Coding

* Code refactoring is done    
* Code is in standard format  
* Code is inspected (by a static code inspector)  
* PCR (Peer Code Review) performed  
* Assumptions of user story met  
* Project builds without errors  

## Testing

* Unit tests written and passed  
* Integration tests written and passed  
* Project deployed on the test environment    
* QA (Quality Assurance) session performed  
* Issues from QA session resolved  
* Acceptance criteria is met  
* Any configuration or build changes documented  
* User documentation updated  
* Technical documentation updated  

# DoD checklist for sprint

* DoD of the user stories met for each single user story included in the Sprint  
* All “to do” in the code completed  
* All unit tests passing  
* All integration tests passing   
* Product backlog updated
