!["Moving to Berlin"](/images/moving-to-berlin.jpg)
My wife and I decided to move to Berlin. That was not an easy decision. I am not intented to go to the travel details (how to find the job, how to get the visa, how to travel,...) now. Maybe in the near future I will talk about this issues. Currently I want to talk about my movitations here.

# Escape from the limitations of Iran

Yeah, that was the main reason for us. When I talk about limitations, I mean it in every aspect. The government decides for us what to see or what not to see; what to wear and what not to wear; what to listen and what not to listen. The government thinks that we are all little children that need to be guided. Lastly they enabled Google safe search for all Iranians. Is it funny? I don't think so. Among the limitations of living in Iran, the worst thing for a developer is limited access to internet. The government blacked out the whole internet for two weeks in 2019. We have a very dumb internet filteration. Every social network is banned by default. We have only limited list of internal websites + instagram and whatsapp. Sanctions against Iran is another reason. Almost all important services on the Internet have banned Iranian users. In Iran, we are under pressure from both sides.
