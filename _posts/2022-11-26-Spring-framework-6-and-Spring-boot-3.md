!["Spring framework 6.0 and Spring Boot 3.0 release"](/images/spring_6.jpg)
`Spring framework 6.0` is generally available from 10 days ago (11/16/2022). I am very eager to test its new features and more than that, use it on a real project. I think that new `Spring framework 6.0` is Spring's plan to tackle all challenges from previous versions. New powerfull competitors like `Quarkus` and `Micronaut` emerged these years with neat and beautiful features that invites Spring to a fight, and this is Spring response to those invitations! So lets take a look at `Spring framework 6.0` new features!

# Spring framework 6.0 new features

## Spring Boot 3  
The new version of Spring Boot, `Spring Boot 3.0` is released with new `Spring Framework 6.0`. So all new changes in `Spring framework 6.0` automatically applies to `Spring Boot 3.0`.

## Java 17  
`Spring Framework 6.0` minimum Java version is Java 17. You can use new cool features from Java 8 to Java 17 in your Spring or Spring Boot projects! If you want to see a list of those changes in Java versions see ["Java Features from Java 8 to Java 17"](https://reflectoring.io/java-release-notes/).

## Jakarta EE 9  
`Spring Framework 6.0` supports `Jakarta EE 9`, with a focus on the recently released `Jakarta EE 10` APIs such as `Servlet 6.0` and `JPA 3.1` (`Hibernate 6.1`) at runtime. It is now compatible with the latest web servers like `Tomcat 10` and `Jetty 11`. 

## Upgrade to Kotlin 1.7  
If you like most of the `Java` developers, like `kotlin`, then this is a good news for you! Now you can use `Kotlin 1.7` in your Spring and Spring Boot projects! Visit ["What's new in Kotlin 1.7.0"](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/whatsnew17.html) to know what is new in `Kotlin 1.7`.

## GraalVM Native Image
With the rise of `shorter start-up time` and `lower memory consumption` needs, now `GraalVM` has kept the Java world very busy! Native Image as part of GraalVM allows JVM-based programs to be compiled ahead of time (AOT) to create a binary that starts natively on the respective operating system. 

## Compatibility with virtual threads 
`Java Virtual Threads` (`Project Loom`) is available since Java 19 in September 2022 as a preview feature. Virtual threads dramatically reduce the effort of writing, maintaining, and observing high-throughput concurrent applications. If you want to know more about visit ["Embracing Virtual Threads"](https://spring.io/blog/2022/10/11/embracing-virtual-threads).

## Remove all deprecated features
`‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍S‍pring framework 6.0` and `Spring Bo‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍ot 3.0` now removed all long-deprecated classes and features. So if you want to migrate an old project to Spring/Spring Boot, you have to be very cautious!
